# Introduction:
This labs consist of coin change using dynamic programming and greedy algorithm.
# Analysis: 
Dynamic programming gives best results as compared to greedy. 
In most of the cases they most gives same results but greedy goes with the greedy logic but dynamic find an optimal solution if exists.
# My Approach:
My approach is this that my program first finds result using dynamic programming, and then it shows results with greedy algorithm. 
# How to run program:
Simple click on run application button and program runs and give results like first it shows dynamic programming and then greedy algorithm results.
